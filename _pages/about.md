I am associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Engineering and Architecture, University of Bologna. My research concerns computer vision and primarily focuses on scene perception with monocular, stereo, and multi-view setups and sensor fusion between LiDARs/ToFs and cameras. Iâ€™m IEEE Senior member. A short CV is available [here(/files/CV_ENG.PDF)].
