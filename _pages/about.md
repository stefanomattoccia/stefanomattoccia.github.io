I am associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Engineering and Architecture, University of Bologna.

My research concerns computer vision, primarily focusing on scene perception with monocular, stereo, and multi-view setups and sensor fusion between depth sensors and cameras. 

A more detailed summary of my academic activity is available in this [CV](/files/CV_ENG.pdf).
